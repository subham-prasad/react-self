# 1) What is Emmet?
Emmets are an add-on to a text editor that allows typing shortcuts that are expanded into full code, the chances of typos and errors also become because of the emmet.

# 2) What is the difference between a library and a framework?
By using a library you can control the flow of the program, but by using the framework, you will control the flow. The framework puts the code where required but it will call your code as required.
	The library provides developers with predefined functions and objects to make the work easier and boost the development process.
The framework is like a foundation on which developers build the application or the for specific platforms.
library - modules, objects, classes, functions: React JS JQuery
Framework- APIs, Compliers, toolsets, Support: Spring NodeJS AngularJS

# 3) What is CDN and why do we use it?
 A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of servers that caches content close to the end users. A CDN allows quick transfers of information needed for loading the internet content, HTML files, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
benefits-
Improving website load times
reducing bandwidths costs
increase content availability and redundancy
improving website security

# 4) Why is react known as react?
React is known as reacting because it reacts. React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
in other words, react is completely frontend and specializes in things in which user interacts when they are using a website like buttons scroll search bar etc.

# 5) What is DOM?

# 6) What is the difference between Async and Differ?
Async means to load javascript files asynchronously, which means if the script is in async it will be loaded independently of other scripts and on the page and not block the page from loading.
if several scripts are loading them all asynchronously will increase the page load-up time, because the browser can download and execute them in parallel.
<script async src="script.js"></script>
Defer- by using the different attributes in HTML, the browser will only load the script only after parsing the page, This can be helpful when the script tag is dependent on the other script tags, or to improve the loading time of the page.
<script defer src="script.js"></script>

# 7) What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
In development mode, we can enable and utilize React developer tools, dev tools profiler, and debugging environment attached with source code. We can utilize various functionalities such as Hot Module Replacement, and diagnostics so that the development environment will help to debug code.

In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce the size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.

# 8) What is cross Origin?
   Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for integrating applications. CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. This is useful because complex applications often reference third-party APIs and resources in their client-side code. For example, your application may use your browser to pull videos from a video platform API, use fonts from a public font library, or display weather data from a national weather database. CORS allows the client browser to check with the third-party servers if the request is authorized before any data transfers.
